### Command Format

Use consistent formatting for commands:

another-command                      # Another description

```markdown
## üü¢ Level X: Title
*Brief description*

### Subsection
```bash
# Commands here
```

### Additional notes or explanations

### Documentation Standards

1. **Commands must be tested** - Don't add commands you haven't verified
2. **Include descriptions** - Every command should have a clear explanation
3. **Use proper markdown** - Follow consistent formatting
4. **Group related commands** - Keep similar commands together
5. **Be concise** - Keep descriptions short and clear

### Example Format

```markdown
### File Operations
```bash
gemini @file.txt                     # Include file in context
gemini @folder/                      # Include entire folder
gemini --model gemini-1.5-pro        # Switch to Pro model
```

**Note:** The `@` symbol is used for file inclusion, while `--model` changes the active model.

```markdown
